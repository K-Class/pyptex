This file is supposed to explain the community guidelines 
for pyptex. However, at present there is no pyptex community. 
Anyone using pyptex is most probably academic. So the code of
conduct shall be,

"Be collegial."

I'm told I should spell out repercussions for breaking this
"code" but I can only thing of obvious things that go without
saying, like banning, blocking or reporting people.

Thanks,

S
