Rules for contributing:

1. Make sure you're using my githooks. You can "make reinstall-hooks" to
   install them. These hooks will ensure all your commits pass unit tests,
   and confirm this by adding a "validation line" to your commit messages.
2. Rebase to master if necessary.
3. Make your changes, commit them, send me a pull request.

Cheers,

S
